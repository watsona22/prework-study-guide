# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This guide offers code bootcamp participants a quick reference for the four key topics covered in the course Prework.

In creating it I learned how to represent content using an editor and related tools to make local edits, push them to the Git environment and update local holdings with the main line of code, all while using the Git workflow.

## Usage

Students can use this guide to reference a few critical key points about those major topics inside the Prework training modules: HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript.

Likewise, if participants choose to view the DevTools console, students can view the topics alongside a randomized list of suggested topics to consider first. This has the added benefit of showing active Javascript code.
